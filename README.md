# Escape: A 2D Puzzle Game

You, a Civil Engineer have been kidnapped by an evil organisation. You must escape by aligning the power lines and opening the gates to your freedom. Solve a series of puzzles formed by the power lines you once put down yourself, and collaborate with other players using a built-in multiplayer system.

## Controls:
WASD to move

R to rotate the power lines

Esc to pause

## Gameplay overview:
You control a civil engineer around the woods you are trapped in. You can select a power line by looking at it while being next to it, and rotate it to align it with other power lines. The power lines are powered by source blocks scattered around. You must align the power lines to open gates in order to progress and access other puzzles.

The puzzles are not seperate levels, instead the entire map is a single puzzle and you need to solve all of it. The game consists of mini puzzles that can be small but need to interact with each other in order for them to be completed. For example, you need to open a gate via a puzzle to gain access to the power lines required for another gate.

The game also has a basic multiplayer system implemented. Multiple players can interact with the game at the same time, and the player's movement and actions sync with each other. Please note that the implementation is still quite buggy and the game can sometimes get locked if too many players interact with the same objects.

There are also 13 orbs scattered around that you can collect as side-quests.

The puzzles all converge to open the final two gates, which when you go through the game ends.
